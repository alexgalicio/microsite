          The College of Information and Communications Technology traces back
          its rich heritage from the College of Industrial Technology of the
          then Bulacan College of Arts and Trade. Started as the Computer
          Department of the College of Industrial Technology in 1989, the
          department was in-charge of the two-year Computer Technician Course
          with Mr. Alexander S. dela Paz and Mr. Fausto S. Hilario as pioneer
          computer instructors with the latter as Area Chairman. Using two
          computer laboratory rooms in the first floor of Integrated Building
          and with less than 15 computers per laboratory, the course was focused
          on computer software and hardware familiarization. During the
          succeeding years, additional sections for the Computer Technician
          course was created in order to cater to the growing demand on
          computer-related graduates. With the increase in section, additional
          computer instructors were hired as well as additional computer units.
          With this development, the CIT Computer Department was converted to
          BCAT&apos;s Computer Center. With the conversion of BCAT to Bulacan
          State University in the year 1996 and the desire to spread computer
          literacy in University, President Rosario P. Pimentel envisioned of
          further widening the scope of the Computer Center. And in 1999 the
          vision became a reality with the approval of the University Board of
          Regents and the ardent campaign of Mr. Hilario; the BCAT Computer
          Center was converted to the Institute of Computer Education with Mr.
          Fausto S. Hilario as Dean.

          History of CICT - As Institute of Computer Education, the seven
          sections of Bachelor in Industrial major in Computer Technology were
          turned over to the Institute from the College of Industrial
          Technology. Additional rooms were acquired for the Institute. The
          Jewellery-Making Shops in the first floor of the Integrated Building
          were vacated in order to be used as Digital Electronic laboratory
          rooms. Reorientations of electrical installations were done as well as
          furnishing of the computer laboratory rooms to make it more suitable
          for the student and instructors use. Additional computer units as well
          as computer chairs were also acquired. The Institute knows that aside
          from curricular development, extra curricular development should also
          be monitored and supported, and with this, the Association of Computer
          Technology Students was created with Mr. Jaime P. Pulumbarit as first
          adviser. Faculty development was also done through trainings and
          seminars with government and private agencies like the National
          Computer Center, MOSCOM Internet, and Colombo Plan to name a few. With
          these trainings, faculty members enhanced their skills in programming,
          multimedia authoring, and web page development. The Institute was also
          active in extension services since 1992. Forging agreement between the
          Bulacan State University and the Department of Budget and Management
          Region III, ICE conducted electronic spreadsheet and database
          management. to its personnel. Series of seminar-workshop were also
          conducted for the Department of Education, Culture and Sports through
          the help of the then Division Superintendent Fe S. Ventura. Focusing
          on computer operations, word processing, electronic spread sheet and
          database management, public school principals were educated. These
          extension services were done during weekends and on semestral breaks.
          With these developments, ICE also served as a service institute,
          teaching computer literacy classes for students under College of
          Education, College of Industrial Technology, College of Arts and
          Sciences, Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts, and Institute of
          Home Economics With the start of the new millennium, the ICE Faculty
          headed by Director Hilario started the formulation of the Bachelor of
          Science in Information Technology curriculum. And with the approval of
          the Board of Regents, the BSIT program was offered at the start of
          Academic Year 2001-2002, which year after year gradually increase the
          number of enrolees as well as the number of sections. With this
          increase demands the demand for additional instructors and computer
          laboratory rooms. New instructors highly skilled and knowledgeable in
          the field of programming, networking, and computer hardware
          maintenance were hired. Two rooms used by the College of Arts and
          Sciences were acquired as well as additional rooms from the former
          Public Highways office. Three more rooms where also constructed in the
          ground floor of the Engineering Building that was used by the BSIT and
          BIT-Comp Tech students. Also a room was acquired from the College of
          Education Building which is use for Digital Electronics laboratory
          rooms and National Service Training Program of ICE students. In order
          to further promote the use of web browsing and the Internet, another
          room was constructed in the ground floor Engineering Building that was
          use for Internet rentals and managed by Websat that was later turned
          over to the ICE which was developed as a lecture room and for Internet
          rentals. The Internet rental is being utilized by almost all students
          of the University with high-speed Digital Subscriber Line connection.
          The BSIT students also formed their own student organization, the
          Society for the Welfare of Information Technology Students with Dr.
          Victoria P. Valenzuela as first adviser. In the same time, the
          Institute formed its official newsletter, the CURSOR and the ICE
          Parent-Teacher Associate was also organized with Engr. Ricardo Correa,
          Sr. as first President. During this period, Dr. Alexander S. dela Paz
          was appointed as Associate Dean who also headed the Internal Quality
          Assessment Unit of the Institute. And on the year 2005, the first
          batch of BSIT students graduated together with the graduates from the
          2-year and 4-year Computer Technology course. In the opening of
          Academic Year 2005-2006, the Institute formally had three area
          chairmen handling the programs offered by the ICE. Engr. Lilibeth V.
          Sandoval, Mr. Gerriper T. Bernardo, Mrs. Evangeline F. Gonzales headed
          the BSIT Program, BIT-Comp Tech program, and Computer Related courses
          respectively. As the saying goes, perseverance today, prosperity
          tomorrow, the Institute has come along way and with the start of the
          Academic Year 2007-2008; the Board of Regent approved the conversion
          of the Institute of Computer Education to the College of Information
          and Communication technology with Mr. Fausto S. Hilario as College
          Dean. Mrs. Evangeline F. Gonzales, Mr. Gerriper T. Bernardo, and Mrs.
          Ma. Fita S. Reyes was appointed as department head for BSIT Program,
          BIT-Computer Technology Program, and Computer Related courses
          respectively. The CIT Computer Department, BCAT Computer Center,
          Institute of Computer Education, and now the College of Information
          and Communication Technology have gone along way. Starting with just
          two computer laboratory it now has 17 rooms. From less than 15
          computer units per room, it now has an average of 25 computers per
          room or roughly 400 computers. And with two computer instructors in
          1989, it has more than 50 faculty members skilled in the diversified
          field of ICT. With this development, the CICT further aims to soar
          high in this era of information age not only in the University but in
          the whole region as well.
