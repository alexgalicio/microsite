        BULACAN STATE UNIVERSITY (BulSU) is the premiere state-operated
        institution of higher learning in the Cenral Luzon region. It originated
        as a secondary school run by the Americans in 1904, and has now
        progressed into one of the biggest educational institutions in Region
        III. BulSU was converted from a college into a University in 1993 by
        virtue of Republic Act 7665. Since then, BulSU has grown by leaps and
        bounds, in terms of program offerings, faculty qualification, and
        student enrolment. It is the vision of the University to be a
        knowledge-generating institution globally recognized for excellent
        instruction, pioneering research, and responsive community engagement.
        The University has also maintained the existence of four external
        campuses within the province namely Meneses Campus, Hagonoy Campus,
        Sarmiento Campus, Bustos Campus, and San Rafael Campus The University
        has been consistently producing highly professional, ethical, and
        service-oriented individuals who perform well in board examinations with
        impressive results consistently exceeding the National Passing Rate and

        Level II Institutional Accreditation while 50 academic programs of the
        different Colleges are already accredited by the Accrediting Agency of
        Chartered Colleges and Universities (AACCUP), Inc. This was made
        possible through the persistent hardwork and resolute service of its
        1,138 faculty members and 476 non-teaching personnel who relentlessly
