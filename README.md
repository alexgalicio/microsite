<h1 align="center">Microsite</h1>  

A multi-tenant website builder built with Next.js for the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) at Bulacan State University (BUlSU). It allows student organizations to create and customize their own website.

## üìù Overview

This project was created as our capstone project. We noticed that student organizations usually rely on scattered social media posts to share updates which can be hard to keep track of.

Microsite was our solution to:

- Give each student org their own space to share information, updates, and resources.
- Make it simple to build and customize a site with no coding skills needed.
- Provide a central landing page for CICT where students can get info and ask questions via a chatbot.
